## Unreleased

### Features

- **ui:** add All workflows navigation and chained relationship inspection, shared documentation/Mermaid semantics, and selected Arazzo 1.1 inspection with explicit support limits.
- **ui:** export `RelationshipEdgeData` through both entry points and include `relationship` in edge unions. Exhaustive edge-data consumers must handle the additive variant; callback signatures remain unchanged.

### Bug Fixes

- **ui:** preserve references under unsupported schema dialects regardless of component or subschema names, while keeping literal and extension payloads opaque.
- **ui:** project relationship selection events onto the public contract without leaking private model or routing data.
